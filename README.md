# Week-4-VSD-RISC-V-Tapeout-Program

This documentation gives a practical introduction to using Ngspice for circuit simulation. It covers DC and transient analysis and shows how to:
- Write and run SPICE netlists
- Read and understand simulation results
- Check the behavior of analog and digital circuits
It provides the basics needed to simulate and verify circuits before building them in hardware.

## Objectives

- **Learn MOSFET Basics:** Understand how MOSFETs work, their key characteristics, and important parameters such as I–V curves, threshold voltage, and effects like velocity saturation.

- **Study CMOS Inverter Behavior:** Explore the inverter’s Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) and transient response to see how it switches, its gain, and propagation delays.

- **Assess Noise Margins and Reliability**: Identify safe logic HIGH and LOW levels, calculate noise margins, and evaluate how the inverter handles voltage fluctuations and noise.

- **Explore Supply and Device Variations**: See how changes in supply voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>) and transistor sizing (W/L ratios) affect VTC, switching threshold, noise margins, and timing, ensuring reliable operation under different conditions.

- **Gain Practical Design Insights:** Relate transistor-level behavior to circuit-level performance, helping design fast, robust, and noise-tolerant digital circuits.
